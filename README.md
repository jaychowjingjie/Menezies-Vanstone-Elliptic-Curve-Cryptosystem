# Menezies-Vanstone-Elliptic-Curve-Cryptosystem
Utilized the Uberzahl library to implement a variant of the Elliptic Curve Cryptosystem called the Menezies-Vanstone Elliptic Curve Cryptosystem. My ex-professor Prof. Emeritus Kevin Compton has since retired from the University of Michigan College of Engineering, Department of Computer Science. During my undergraduate education, I learned a great deal from him in EECS475(Applied Cryptography, Winter 2018) and EECS376(Foundations of Computer Science, Winter 2017)
